\maketitle

This report is generated automatically by the script, which you can find in
the GitHub repository \href{https://github.com/yegor256/cam}{yegor256/cam}.

We found and retrieved \iexec{cat "${TARGET}/repositories.csv" | wc -l | xargs}
repositories from GitHub.
\iexec{cat "${TARGET}/temp/repo-details.tex"}
The full list of them is in the \ff{repositories.csv} file.
The \ff{hashes.csv} file has a list of Git hashes of their latest commits.
The filtering process was the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\iexec{cat "${TARGET}"/temp/reports/*.tex}
\end{enumerate}

The structure of the archive:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \ff{data/} is the collection of \ff{.csv} files with the data
  you are looking for (\iexec{find "$TARGET/data" -name '*.csv' | wc -l | xargs} total);

  \item \ff{github/} is the entire collection of
  \iexec{find "${TARGET}/github" -name '*.java' | wc -l | xargs}
  source files ``as is''
  (\iexec{du -sh "${TARGET}/github" | cut -f1 | xargs} total);
\end{itemize}

There are \iexec{cat "${TARGET}/temp/list-of-metrics.tex" | wc -l | xargs} metrics that we use:

\begin{itemize}
  \input{$TARGET/temp/list-of-metrics.tex}
\end{itemize}

It took \iexec{"${LOCAL}/help/tdiff.sh" "$(cat "${TARGET}/start.txt")"} hours
to generate this report.
